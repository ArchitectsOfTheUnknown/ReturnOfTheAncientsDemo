# SUBNAUTICA: RETURN OF THE ANCIENTS DEMO

### ⚠️ DEMO BUILD - NO STORY CONTENT

This is the official demo release of Return of the Ancients, a large content mod centered around the Gargantuan
Leviathan. If you do not wish to be spoiled for the final version of RotA, then proceed with caution. This mod has
previously been covered by various content creators over time with plenty of anticipation, and finally we have a public
release available for everyone to enjoy!

The main focus of this mod is, of course, the Gargantuan Leviathan, an incomprehensibly large ancient leviathan.
However, there are plenty of other secrets that have yet to be discovered.

The demo build is similar to the content creator build, though with extra polish and features to make the new technology
accessible in survival mode. This means that most story locations, events, voice lines, etc. are excluded. Those will
only be present in the final release.
